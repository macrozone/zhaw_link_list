link-list
==============

A simple application, that enables you and your friends to share links (e.g. for school).

You can login with email, facebook, google and github and can comment on other's links. It also integrates a [chatworks](https://github.com/Pent/chatworks)-chat-window.

I did it initially for my class at zhaw school of engeneering, but feel free to fork & extend it.

Runs on [meteor](http://meteor.com) (v0.8.0)
